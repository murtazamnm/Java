Two goats are trying to cross a narrow bridge from opposite sides. 
They meet in the middle, and they start pushing each other. 
Independently of each other, the goats take some time, and then push the other goat one step. 
Whenever one of the goats is pushed off of the bridge, the game ends. 
the speed of the goats (how much they wait between pushes) and the length of the bridge are taken as parameters;
